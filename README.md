TheoreticalMoments/Readme.txt file contains updates on fitting the theoretical moment to the data. 

TheoreticalMoments/Jacobian.R: Sensitivity analysis of moments with respect to parameter seleciton. 

TheoreticalMoments/Equilibrium2/Equilibrium2: Family of files to calibrate the model. main.cpp; mainRcpp.cpp; mainTesla.cpp. 
    

    mainSansC_prod: Contains the equilibrium computation and calibration without the variable C that is inside of the production function used to increase the number of entrepreneurs. 

TheoreticalMoments/Equilibrium2/Equilibrium2/GenerateSobolNumbers: Generate sobol numbers to compute distance between empirical and theoretical moments.
